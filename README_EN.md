# QingZhu v0.2.0

## Project Introduction
- **QingZhu** (official name) is a text creation tool, primarily exploring the application of AI in text creation.
- **Supported Platforms**: Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 11
- Respects different users' habits by not providing pre-made "one-click features"
- Aims to integrate AI into the writing process, improving efficiency and extending the author's thinking, rather than replacing the author

# Core Features

## 0. Built-in Butler Agent
Allows AI to operate backend APIs, directly performing actions on behalf of the user (currently in early stages)

---

## 1. Tool Calling
Consistent with the core logic of Cursor / Cline / Roo Code / opencode / Kilo Code, with some design differences:

Supports **Human-in-the-Loop**, encouraging users to frequently intervene in AI content generation for timely corrections

You can also enable **Auto-Approval** to let AI fully automate task execution

## 2. Themes
Supports Day/Night modes and custom theme color schemes

---

## 3. RAG Knowledge Base
Allows AI to retrieve necessary information, improving results

![8](./images/8.png)

- **Two-step RAG**: Before calling AI, uses the user's message as input to retrieve relevant information, which is returned to AI along with other context
- **Agentic RAG**: Gives AI two knowledge base tools, allowing AI to autonomously decide whether to query data

---

## 4. Regular Search
Standard text editor feature

Allows users to search through text

---

## 5. Checkpoints
Standard text editor feature

Allows users to save file content as checkpoints, restore to previous versions, and view differences between different checkpoints

---

## 6. Provider Adaptation

Supports **11 providers**

Supports **custom providers** (OpenAI-compatible)

Includes a built-in embedding model, ready to use out of the box

---

## 7. MCP Client

Supports connecting to MCP servers

![10](./images/10.png)

---

## 8. Skills Support

Can integrate various skills, similar to OpenClaw and Claude Code

![3](./images/3.png)

---

## 9. Others:
*   **Command Execution**: Allows AI to execute commands directly, such as Python, npm, etc.
*   **Terminal**: Terminal panel similar to VS Code and other editors, capable of executing command lines
*   ...and more

# Quick Start

## Installation & Startup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FlickeringLamp/ai-novelist.git
cd ai-novelist
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Enter the frontend directory (`frontend/`), install dependencies, build, and start:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies
From the root directory (`ai-novelist`), create a virtual environment, activate it, install backend dependencies, then return to root and start:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv backend_env
backend_env\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
python -m venv backend_env
source backend_env/bin/activate

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.lock
cd ..
python main.py
```

> **Note**: Using `requirements.lock` ensures all dependencies are fully version-locked to avoid compatibility issues. For development environments that need the latest versions, use `requirements.txt` instead.

### 4. Access via Browser
Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000

### 5. Other Startup Methods
From the root directory:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run electron-dev
```

**Note**: When starting with `electron-dev`, the terminal feature is available. The web version lacks the Node.js main process, so the terminal feature is unavailable.
